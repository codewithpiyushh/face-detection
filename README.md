# YOLOv4 Object Detection 

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use the **YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4)** model for object detection. YOLOv4 is a state-of-the-art model used for real-time object detection in various applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and more.

## Features

- Implementation of YOLOv4 using a Jupyter notebook interface.
- Easy-to-understand step-by-step instructions on how to load and run YOLOv4 for object detection.
- Covers image preprocessing, model loading, and detection result visualization.
- Capable of detecting multiple objects in real time.

## Repository Structure

- `YoloV4_Notebook.ipynb` - The main Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to load the YOLOv4 model and run object detection on sample images.
- `README.md` - This file, explaining the purpose and setup of the repository.
